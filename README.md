## Description

This README generator uses inquirer to obtain the user's input from questions run through a function on the terminal.  Using this input, a README.md file is created that is filled in with the input.

## Installation

This generator was made using javaScript.  also necessary was installing and implementing inquirer.  Using the data collected, a generateLicenseBadge function was created to apply a license badge to the top of the README depending on the users choice. 

A generateREADME function was written in order to combine text layout for the README with the user input to fill out the README file. This function was assigned to a const inside the inquirer function.

Finally, a writeFile function was called using this newly created const in order to create a "exampleREADME.md" file.
